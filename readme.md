## Improvements We'd Make
- We'd love to have the A.R. working in to the point where one can use the camera to snap an image (ARReferenceImage) of an object to then be used in the app, without the name to import them into XCode as targets then rebuild the app each time.
- Carers would be able to log-in to see the schedule shared with them as read-only.
